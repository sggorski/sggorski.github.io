🚀 Welcome to my digital realm! I'm currently immersed in the exciting world of collaborative game development as part of a dynamic group project. Our collective creativity is fueling the creation of our very own game – a thrilling journey where each line of code contributes to a masterpiece in the making.

🎓 At the moment, my intellectual playground is AGH University of Science and Technology, where I'm diving into the depths of knowledge, exploring the intricate landscape of technology and honing my skills.

🤝 I'm on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on intriguing programming projects. The thrill of teamwork and the synergy of ideas are what propel me forward in the ever-evolving realm of technology.

💡 In the coding realm, I've danced with languages like C++ and Python, crafting digital solutions and bringing ideas to life. I've also harnessed the power of Microsoft Power BI to unravel insights and tell compelling data stories.

When I'm not lost in lines of code, you'll find me indulging in my diverse set of hobbies. From deciphering the complexities of Rubik's cubes to the precision of playing tennis, I thrive on the challenge of each endeavor. I'm also a fervent observer of football and speedway, cheering for the adrenaline-fueled moments.

✈️ Beyond the digital horizon, I have a passion for exploration and discovery. Traveling allows me to broaden my perspectives and gain inspiration from the diverse cultures and landscapes that our world has to offer.

Join me on this journey of continuous learning, exploration, and creation. I'm here not just to accomplish tasks but to gain more – more knowledge, more experiences, and more opportunities to make a positive impact in the vast landscape of technology. Let's code, play, and explore together! 💻🎮
